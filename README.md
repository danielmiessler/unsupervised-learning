# Unsupervised Learning

![ul-logo](https://danielmiessler.com/images/ul-wide.jpg)

[Unsupervised Learning](https://danielmiessler.com/newsletter/) is a community of smart, curious, and kind people sharing and discussing ideas around the topics of security, technology, and human society. 

People in the Unsupervised Learning community value learning more than most. We all read books, watch YouTube, listen to podcasts, go to conferences, and do a dozen other activities to improve ourselves.

But as I talked about in my post, [Lens vs. List Learning](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/lens-vs-list-learning/), there's a difference between reading or watching something, vs. learning it. Or, put another way, the problem isn't the *learning*, the problem is **incorporating that learning into your daily routines**.

## Algorithmic learning

This resource is focused on a concept I call [Algorithmic Learning](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/algorithmic-learning/), which aims to solve this problem of consumption without integration. The idea is this:

1. You should have a **methodology** for doing the things that matter a lot in your life, such as your daily routine.
2. That methodology should, at any given time, represent the best possible way you know how to do that thing.
3. When you expose yourself to new ideas and new approaches to problems, you should not rely purely on passive or osmosis-based learning. Instead, you should be thinking explicitly about how this new way of doing things can or should *modify your existing methodology*.
4. So when you hear something that meets your standard of being something you want to incorporate, don't just think to yourself, "Hmm, that's interesting…I should try that…". Instead, go to your current methodology and update it to include this new thing that you've learned.
5. This turns learning---for key aspects of your life---from passive to active. From osmosis to algorithm.

This is why we call it Algorithmic Learning. It's updating a series of steps based on new---and hopefully better---information.

## Unsupervised Learning algorithms and methodologies

> When I get new information about a topic, I change my algorithm. What do you do, sir?

This resource will be a series of these methodologies developed for myself and for the Unsupervised Learning community.

Each methodology will not only include the current steps (algorithm) for the activity, but will also contain references for why a given step was included. For example, if my daily routine says go outside and get 10 minutes of sunlight within 10 minutes of waking up, I will mention the fact that this step came from [Andrew Huberman, in Episode #2, titled Master Your Sleep & Be More Alert When Awake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ).

Using this system, you not only have a solid methodology, but you also have all the research that went into its creation. And best of all, it's all in ```git```, so you can see the evolution of the methodologies over time.

So that's the project. I hope you find a methodology here worth adopting as your own.
