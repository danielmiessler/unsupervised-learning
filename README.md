[Unsupervised Learning](https://danielmiessler.com/newsletter/) is a community based around being smart, curious, and kind around the topics of security, technology, and human society. 

Anyone reading this text values learning. We all read books, watch YouTube, listen to podcasts, go to conferences, and do a dozen other activities to improve ourselves.

As I talked about in my post, [Lens vs. List Learning](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/lens-vs-list-learning/), the problem isn't the *learning*, the problem is **incorporating that learning into your daily routines**.
